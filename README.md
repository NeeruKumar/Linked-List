# Linked-List
Implementation of Linked List in python

LinkedList.py is a simple implementation of Linked List in python. I have refered various resources to make the different methods of the Linked List.

Following are the methods implemented

    1. isEmpty() : method returns true if the list is empty

    2. addToStart(): method to add a node at starting

    3. addToEnd() : method to add a node at the end

    4. display() : method to display all the elements of the Linked List

    5. length() : method that returns the length of the Linked List

    6. insert() : method to insert element at a given position in the Linked List

    7. removePosition() : method to delete a element at a given position

    8. remove() : method to delete a data element

    9. findMin() : method that returns the max element

    10. findMax() : method that returns the min element

    11. count() : method that returns the occurences of an element

    12. pop() : pop method removes last element of the Linked List
